  <h1>Still Willing to Try</h1>
  <p class="intro">Sophy, this isn’t just a website. It’s a window into my heart.</p>
  <div class="letter">
    <p>Dear Sophy,</p>
    <p>I don’t know if you’ll read this. I don’t know if you’ll smile, cry, or close the tab. But I needed to say this somewhere that felt real. Somewhere that felt like you.</p>
    <p>I’ve had time to think. Time to feel the silence. Time to realize that what we had wasn’t ordinary—it was rare. And rare things deserve to be fought for.</p>
    <p>I’m not perfect. I’ve made mistakes. I’ve let fear speak louder than love. But I’ve grown. I’ve learned. And through it all, my heart keeps coming back to you.</p>
    <p>I’m still willing to try. To listen. To learn. To love you better.</p>
    <p>If there’s even a flicker of hope in you, I’ll be here.</p>
    <p>No pressure. No expectations. Just a quiet, steady hope.</p>
    <p>Yours,<br />Chidi</p>
  </div>
  <div class="footer">
    If you ever feel ready to talk, I’ll be here.
